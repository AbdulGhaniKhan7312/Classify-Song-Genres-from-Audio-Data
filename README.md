# Music Genre Classification: Hip-Hop vs. Rock ðŸŽµ

This project classifies songs as either Hip-Hop or Rock based on audio features using machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview

1. Objective: Develop a model to classify songs into Hip-Hop or Rock genres.
2. Dataset: Used data compiled by The Echo Nest, including features like danceability, acoustics, and more.
3. Algorithms: Implemented Decision Trees and Logistic Regression, validated with K-fold cross-validation.

## Key Features

1. Data Preparation: Merged and cleaned datasets (CSV and JSON formats) containing song metadata and audio features.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualized key features to understand genre differentiation.
3. Modeling: Built and evaluated models with pipelines, ensuring proper scaling, feature reduction (PCA), and validation.
4. Performance: Achieved solid classification results, with balanced accuracy across both genres.
